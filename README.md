# r-dev-day

Repo to organize tasks for R Dev Days.

## Discussions

Use [Discussions](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/discussions) if you want to discuss and get support for ideas before creating an issue.

## Issues

Use [Issues](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/discussions) to propose tasks, ideally describing the issue sufficiently for someone to get started quickly.

### Scope

Suitable tasks for the R Dev Day:

 - Addressing a bug report on [R's Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/)
 - Follow-up to a discussion on the [R-devel mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel)
 - Developing/maintaining R Contributor infrastructure, as linked to on https://contributor.r-project.org/

Other issues with support from an R Core developer/CRAN Team member. These may be issues that you want to start working on at the R Dev Day, or contributions you are already working on that you would be happy to work on with others. 

### Labels

Please make good use of labels to make it easier for people to identify suitable issues. We have the following types of label

 - Event-specific labels, e.g. `Imperial 2024`: these are issues that are recommended to people attending the corresponding event. The labels should be removed afterwards unless contributors plan to continue work in progress after the event.
 - Topic, e.g. `Documentation`, `Graphics` `I/O`: these match the [Bugzilla component](https://bugs.r-project.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=R) and should be used even if the issue does not have a matching bug report.
 - Action, e.g. `discuss fix`, `needs diagnosis`: addressing a bug usually goes through several stages, the label should reflect the next/main action that needs to be worked on at the event.
 - Other, e.g. `C` to label issues that require knowledge of C programming.
