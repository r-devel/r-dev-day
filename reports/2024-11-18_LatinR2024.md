# R Dev Day @ LatinR 2024

## Participants

This was a satellite event to LatinR 2024; both LatinR 2024 and the R Dev Day were held online. 
The R Dev Day was organized as two, 2.5 hour sessions on consecutive days, with open registration; participants could choose to attend either or both sessions. 
There were 47 people that registered, however only 17 participated in the event.

Due to the small numbers, EDIA summaries are not reported for this individual event (they will be summarised over multiple R Dev Days).
