R Dev Day @ SIP 2024, October 8-9, 2024
================

## Participants

This was a satellite event to Shiny in Production 2024, but registration was open to all.
There were 12 people that signed up for the R Dev Day, however only 9 were able to attend on the day.

Due to the small numbers, EDIA summaries are not reported for this individual event (they will be summarised over multiple R Dev Days).

## Issues

As only a few people had previous experience of contributing to R, this event focused on contributor infrastructure. 
In particular, as it was a satellite to a Shiny conference, several people worked on improving the translations dashboard. 

We looked at 11 issues all together, summarised in the table below. 
Most were prepared in advance and a link is given to the corresponding issue on the r-dev-day repo, a few have no link as these issues were identified during the event. 
For the translations dashboard, links go to issues on the source code repository for the dashboard.
