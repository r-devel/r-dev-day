R Dev Day @ Rencontres R 2025, May 22, 2025
================

## Participants

This was a satellite event to Rencontres R 2025, but registration was open to all.
There were 23 people that signed up for the R Dev Day, however only 16 attended on the day, with 3 joining remotely.

Due to the small numbers, EDIA summaries are not reported for this individual event (they will be summarised over multiple R Dev Days).

## Issues

We looked at 12 issues during the Dev Day (unless otherwise stated, links are to issues on the r-dev-day repo, which include links to Bugzilla where relevant).
