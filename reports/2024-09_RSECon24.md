R Development Hackathon @ RSECon24, September 5th, 2024
================

## Participants

This event was open to registered participants of [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/), both online and in-person.
The event took place over two sessions (1.5 and 1.25 hours, respectively); participants could choose to attend either or both sessions.
As there was no direct registration, no EDIA data was collected and records of participants are incomplete. 
Around 25-30 people particicipated.

## Issues

As participants at RSECon24 have a wide range of expertise related to software development and are not necessarily R specialists, 
a lot of issues were prepared relating to contributor infrastructure, as well as R development. Since time 

We looked at 13 issues during the Dev Day (# links to issues on the r-dev-day repo, which include links to R's Bugzilla or the issue on the corresponding source repository).
